SortingAlgorithms

the program offers the user to randomise a dataset with a size and max value to his/hers choice, then to choose an algorithm to sort it by.

the algorithms available are:
1. quickSort
2. insertionSort
3. selectionSort
4. bubbleSort
5. countingSort
6. heapSort

please run both .py files simultaniously through CMD
first run plotWorld.py, then run sortingAlgorithms.py in another command line.

test112.txt is the temporary dataset for the program.
sorting_log.txt is a debug log used in writing the program.

Refer to the mp4 file for a demo.
